This game was inspired by two sperate games:

What I was attempting to create was a 3D block building/lego game. I was mostly successful given the time constraints, and will continue working on this project just for the fun of it.

Known issues
-At a far distance (beyond the max distance), the cursor snaps to the edge of blocks instead of not snapping to anything at all
-Cubes can be created under the floor

Future implementation / Next steps
-Changing the color on the face of the cube where the cursor is locked. I struggled with this a little, and left commented-out code that got close to the solution. The commented-out code gets the face of the cube to change color, but it also changes the color of all other cubes in the scene.
-Snapping cubes to the surface of the floor/preventing the cubes from being created under the floor
-Adding a grid to the floor where blocks can be created in. Similar to the block building game.
-Making a winning situation, where the user has to get to a certain height/build a certain configuration of blocks
-Adding functionality to remove blocks

Much further implementation / new ideas
-If you have not seen Tilt Brush from Google (http://store.steampowered.com/app/327140/) it is awesome.
-What I want to create next is a way for the user to draw in 3D space with the cursor.
-Being able to move the cursor closer or further away, and being able to choose the brush material/color of the brush.
-Click and drag creates continuous objects in the space
